Hi there, 

I’m Jill - a Technical Recruiter who loves tech and meeting new people, so nice to *e-meet* you!  

Originally from the US 🇺🇸 but now I'm living in Australia 🇦🇺 thanks to the flexibility of remote work with [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/BLDrd0/worlds-top-talent), one of the biggest fully remote companies in the world 🌎. Here I have the chance to work in a multi-cultural team with amazing professionals from who I learn something new every single day. 

The #FutureofWork is remote - why would you have to go back to an office if you can work from home :houses: and have a better work-life balance with no commute? Toptal has been connecting top talent with top companies from around the globe for over ten years now for exciting, fully-remote projects.
